Hello! My name is Ping Yang. I'm a master student from school of Mechanical Engineering at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) (XJTU), advised by Prof. [Min Zeng](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/zengmin/2). My research interest includes Heat and Mass Transfer, Two-phase Flow, graphene aerogel composite PCMs, and Computational Fluid Dynamics.

During my graduate studies, I specialized in graphene aerogel composite PCMs and multiphase flow. I have several years of experience in numerical simulation and experiments on graphene aerogel composite PCMs and published some articles about those investigations. Moreover, I studied and specialized in various heat transfer enhancement methods like flow boiling, and I'm proficient in tools such as CFD software, as well as programming languages such as Matlab, C++, and FORTRAN. 

**I am looking for a PhD position of Spring/Fall 2024 intake. Please feel free to [contact](mailto:yang2762473445@stu.xjtu.edu.cn) me for potential opportunities.**
You can find my CV here: [Ping's CV](../assets/CV of Ping Yang.pdf).
