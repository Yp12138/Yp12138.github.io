Hello! My name is Ping Yang. I'm a master student from school of Mechanical Engineering at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) (XJTU), advised by Prof. [Min Zeng](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/zengmin/2). My research interest includes Energy Storage and Sustainability, Heat and Mass Transfer, Two-phase Flow, graphene aerogel composite PCMs, and Computational Fluid Dynamics. 

During my graduate studies, I specialized in **high-efficiency flow heat transfer**, like flow boiling and microchannel heat transfer. Moreover, I have several years of experience in numerical simulation and experiments on graphene aerogel composite PCMs. I'm proficient in tools such as CFD software, as well as programming languages such as Matlab, C++, and FORTRAN. 

**If you are insterested in me, please feel free to [contact](mailto:yang2762473445@stu.xjtu.edu.cn) me for potential opportunities.** 
You can find my CV here: [Ping's CV](https://Yp12138.github.io/assets/CV.pdf).
