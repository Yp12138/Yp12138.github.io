excerpt: 'In this study, a numerical model is developed to quickly predict the flow distribution and heat transfer of two-phase flow in the parallel flow system, and the maximum average relative deviation with experimental data is 4.4%. The effects of geometric parameters and non-uniform thermal load on flow and heat transfer are discussed. '

In this study, a numerical model is developed to quickly predict the flow distribution and heat transfer of two-phase flow in the parallel flow system, and the maximum average relative deviation with experimental data is 4.4%. The effects of geometric parameters and non-uniform thermal load on flow and heat transfer are discussed.
