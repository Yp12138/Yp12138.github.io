title: "*A new structure of PCHE with embedded PCM for attenuating temperature fluctuations and its performance analysis*"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ERZUO-1
excerpt: 'To attenuate the temperature fluctuations in the cycle, this study proposes a new structure with phase change materials embedded in the printed circuit heat exchanger. This structure package can contain a variety of phase change materials in a stepwise arrangement and a composite phase change material with expanded graphene. The effects of different flow directions, the number of layers in the phase change material ladder, whether the phase change material is compounded with expanded graphene or not, and the thickness of the phase change material were numerically compared.'
