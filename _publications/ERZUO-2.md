excerpt: 'In this article, the phase transition behavior of n-eicosane in slit-shaped pores between sheets of graphene is investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the graphene interface makes the phase transition temperature of n-eicosane increase, under the initial slit widths of 1.5–5.3 nm.'
