excerpt: 'This paper summarizes the phenomena and challenges in regenerative cooling, including transcritical thermophysical properties, fuel pyrolysis, and surface coking. The corresponding numerical methods are classified according to their characteristics, including the fuel surrogate, pyrolysis, surface coking, and turbulence models. The scope of application and the advantages and disadvantages of the models are discussed.'

In this study, a numerical model is developed to quickly predict the flow distribution and heat transfer of two-phase flow in the parallel flow system, and the maximum average relative deviation with experimental data is 4.4%. The effects of geometric parameters and non-uniform thermal load on flow and heat transfer are discussed.
