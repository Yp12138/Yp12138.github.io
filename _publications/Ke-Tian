In the present study, the heat and mass transfer processes are investigated by a numerical method to evaluate the mass distribution of pyrolytic products in the near-wall region. A detailed pyrolysis model of RP-3 aviation fuel is incorporated to analyze the pyrolysis process in the regenerative cooling passage.
