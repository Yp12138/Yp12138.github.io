title: "*Solar-thermal energy conversion prediction of building envelope using thermochemical sorbent based on established reaction kinetics*"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Other-1
excerpt: 'In this paper, the dehydration (heat charge) and hydration (discharge) reaction kinetics of thermochemical sorbents synthesised in previous work by the author is established by using the isothermal method, with the aim of understanding their thermochemical conversion behaviour and developing reaction models for numerical simulations. The effects of temperature, reaction advancement, and vapour pressure are fully considered and employed in a thermochemical energy storage model. '
