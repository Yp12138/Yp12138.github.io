title: "*Effect of pressure on regenerative cooling process of endothermic hydrocarbon fuel at severe pyrolysis conditions*"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-AST-number-1
excerpt: 'In order to fill the gap in existing research on the pressure effects at severe pyrolysis, the influence of pressure on the flow field, pyrolysis behaviours, heat transfer, and surface coking are numerically investigated in this study. The results indicate that the velocity-temperature curves at different pressures have two intersections due to the difference in initial pyrolysis temperature, reaction rate, and product distribution.'

In order to fill the gap in existing research on the pressure effects at severe pyrolysis, the influence of pressure on the flow field, pyrolysis behaviours, heat transfer, and surface coking are numerically investigated in this study. The results indicate that the velocity-temperature curves at different pressures have two intersections due to the difference in initial pyrolysis temperature, reaction rate, and product distribution.
